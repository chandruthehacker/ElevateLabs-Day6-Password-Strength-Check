## 📊 How It Works

The password is checked against 5 rules:
1. ✅ Minimum 8 characters
2. ✅ At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
3. ✅ At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
4. ✅ At least one number (0-9)
5. ✅ At least one special character (!@#$%^&*)

The score determines:
- 🔴 Weak (0-2 rules passed)
- 🟡 Moderate (3-4 rules passed)
- 🟢 Strong (All 5 rules passed)

---

## 📌 Best Practices for Strong Passwords

- Use at least 12 characters
- Mix uppercase and lowercase letters
- Include numbers and special symbols
- Avoid common patterns (like `123456`, `password`, `qwerty`)
- Use passphrases (e.g., `Monkey$Dance7!`)
- Use a password manager for storage

## 🔐 Common Password Attacks

- **Brute Force Attack:** Tries all combinations to guess the password
- **Dictionary Attack:** Uses common word lists to guess passwords
- **Phishing:** Tricks users into revealing their password
- **Credential Stuffing:** Uses leaked usernames/passwords from other sites
